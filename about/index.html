        <p>Hey, I'm Sen! I love tinkering and schminkering. I enjoy reverse engineering, patching, gaming, and getting
            lost in all kinds of awesome media.</p>

        <p>I tend to stay pretty low-profile online, but I really enjoy talking to people who share the same interests.
            You can usually find me in the <a href="https://nfsco.club/">NFSCO</a> community, where I also manage
            <b>NFSCO Crew Battles</b>, an unofficial branch that hosts crew battles in the style of classic Need for
            Speed: Carbon.</p>

        <p>At home I live with two little troublemakers, my cat Lemon and my tortoise Taki. I'm a big Soulslike fan and
            have platinumed most of the FromSoft games. I also love metal, especially nu metal and rock bands like
            Linkin Park, Mudvayne, and Element Eighty.</p>

        <p>My favorite film genre is psychological horror, which probably explains why my favorite anime include Serial
            Experiments Lain, Death Note, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Haibane Renmei, and Elfen Lied.</p>

        <p>I'm also pretty proud of my PC setup. It runs a Ryzen 7 9700X and a Radeon 7800 XT in a Lian Li A3 case, with
            a 27” 1440p OLED as my main screen and a 21.5” 1080p as my secondary. I use Edifier R1280DB speakers because
            I really hate wearing headphones. I also love collecting controllers and consoles: I have a few PS2 Slims,
            a PS2 Fat, a PS3 Slim, a PS4, a 2DS, a SNES edition 3DS XL, a PSP Street, a couple of PSP 2000s, and way too
            many others to list.</p>

        <p>Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to join <a href="https://discord.gg/xSAYJWbVsj">The Rabbithole</a> if
            you want to chat!</p>
